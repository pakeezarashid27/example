    <h3>
      Monkey is a common name that may refer to most mammals of the infraorder Simiiformes, also known as the simians. Traditionally, all animals in the group now known as simians are counted as monkeys except the apes, which constitutes an incomplete paraphyletic grouping; however, in the broader sense based on cladistics, apes (Hominoidea) are also included, making the terms monkeys and simians synonyms in regards to their scope.
      These creatures can understand written numbers as well.In rare cases, some monkeys are even able to do basic arithmetic and even multiplication. Scientifically, they are all primates. However, much like the human species, they have a different classification of monkeys. Almost all species of monkeys have tails, yet apes do not.
